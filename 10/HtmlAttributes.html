<!-- An attribute is used to define the 
    characteristics of an HTML element and 
    is placed inside the element's opening tag. 
    All attributes are made up of two parts − a name and a value -->


   <head> 
      <title>Align Attribute  Example</title> 
   </head>
	
   <body> 
      <p align = "left">This is left aligned</p> 
      <p align = "center">This is center aligned</p> 
      <p align = "right">This is right aligned</p> 
   </body>
	
<!-- 
The four core attributes that can be used on the majority of HTML elements (although not all) are −

Id
Title
Class (We will look into this while doing CSS)
Style -->

<p id = "html">This para explains what is HTML</p>
<p id = "css">This para explains what is Cascading Style Sheet</p>


<!-- Often used as a tool tip  -->
<h3 title = "Hello Folks!">Titled Heading Tag Example</h3>

<!-- The style attribute allows you to specify Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) rules within the element. -->
<p style = "font-family:arial; color:#2b00ff;">Some text...</p>
